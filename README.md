## Description

The goal is to get rid of all the bugs! 

Use your bug spray to clean the infested furniture (red = infested, cyan = clear)!

## Development

This is the first game I made all by myself. It is pretty bad but I learned a lot making it. Was made just to learn programming stuff, hence only one level/weapon/bug. Still missing some important features (main menu, inventory, and win screen). I look forward to making more things with Unity though!

New weapons (eg. bug spray) and infestable objects (eg. furniture) can be added pretty easy, since they use scriptable objects/serialized fields (fields that can be changed in the unity editor's inspector).

I used Unity, Visual Studio, Blender 2.8, and Krita to make this. All assets/scripts were made by me.

## Next time

Next time I should better plan out the structure of all the code and use better/consistent git commit messages.

## To get

Not built yet (since don't have a menu), so just clone this repository and open in Unity editor (this was made in 2018.3.8f1). 

Make sure to import TextMesh Pro resources 

*"Window -> TextMeshPro -> Import TMP Essential Resources"*

## To play

Hold your mouse over the red furniture to get rid of the bugs. When there are no more bugs you win (just tell yourself that).

WASD moves the camera, Q/E zoomes in and out.
